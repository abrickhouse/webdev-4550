  "comment": "This film has a lot going on, with the unnecessary Weapon X plot, to trying to make Jennifer Lawrence the main star. I still think this is a great film and is overhated. The film feels like it has big stakes especially with apocalypse as its main villain. The grand final battle, the cast of characters we get from the X-Men to the Fourhorse men. Michael Fassbender, and James McAvoy do another fantastic job as Professor X and Erik. And the quick silver scene is just pure superhero cinema. A great continuation from days of future past."
